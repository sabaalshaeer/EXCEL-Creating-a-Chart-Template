Verify that you are on the Monthly Totals worksheet, and if necessary, select the Monthly Totals combo chart.

Save the chart as a template.

Right-click the chart and then select Save as Template.

In the Save Chart Template dialog box, ensure the Charts folder is selected.

Note: Excel should automatically direct you to the Charts folder. The label in the chart templates path image will be your user name. The AppData folder is typically a hidden system folder, so you will not see the folder when browsing through File Explorer. However, you can type %APPDATA% in the address path to go to that folder directly.
